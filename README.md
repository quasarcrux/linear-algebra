## Project objective
The mission is to build a linear algebra framework in pure Python (without external dependencies), with matrix and vector operations LU/ QR decomposition with pivoting and numerical stability, step by step the classical algorithms, from Doolittle to Householder and SVD.

# Numeral structures
- `core.py` â€“ Linear algebra functions:
- Matrices: creation (`zeros`, `identity`), operations (`add`, `sub`, `matmul`, `transpose`).
- Vectors: dot product, norm, addition, subtraction, scaling.
